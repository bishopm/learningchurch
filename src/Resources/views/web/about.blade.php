        <h3>About LearningChurch</h3>
        <p>We are <a href="{{url('/kym-bishop')}}">Kym Bishop</a> and <a href="{{url('/michael-bishop')}}">Michael Bishop</a>, both ordained Methodist ministers, based in Durban, South Africa.</p>
        <p>We offer the resources on this site in the hope that they will be useful to the local church. The site went live at the end of 2023 and we hope to keep adding video and written content over time. You can contact us <a href="https://learningchurch.org/contact"><b>here</b></a> with any feedback or questions.</p>
